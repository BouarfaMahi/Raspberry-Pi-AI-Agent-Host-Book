# A.1. Main Directory Structure

- `docker-compose.yaml`: Contains the configuration for deploying the Docker services.
- `init.yaml`: Initial configuration file.
- `README.md`: Main documentation for the Docker stack.

## `docker-compose.yaml`

The `docker-compose.yaml` file defines multi-container Docker applications using Docker Compose. This configuration file describes services, networks, and volumes for the Docker stack.

### Services:

#### 1. VSCode Service (`vscode`):

- **build**: 
  - `context`: Specifies the directory containing the Dockerfile.
  - `dockerfile`: Name of the Dockerfile.
- **ports**: Maps the container's port 8080 to the host's port 8080.
- **volumes**: 
  - Mounts the parent directory's `notebooks` folder to the `/home/coder/project` directory inside the container.
- **environment**: Sets the environment variable `PASSWORD` to `yourpassword`.
- **devices**: 
  - Maps I2C and Serial Interfaces inside the container to interact with the BME680 sensor and QUECTEL EG25-G 4G HAT cellular device.

#### 2. Grafana Service (`grafana`):

- **image**: Uses the `grafana/grafana:9.5.1` Docker image.
- **ports**: Maps the container's port 3000 to the host's port 3000.
- **volumes**: 
  - Mounts several directories and named volumes for data persistence and configuration.
- **depends_on**: Specifies that the Grafana service depends on the `questdb` service.
- **environment**: Sets specific environment variables for Grafana configurations.

#### 3. QuestDB Service (`questdb`):

- **image**: Uses the `questdb/questdb:7.3` Docker image.
- **ports**: Maps multiple ports between the container and the host for various QuestDB functionalities.
- **volumes**: 
  - Mounts the named volume `questdb-data` to the specified path in the container.
- **environment**: Sets specific environment variables for QuestDB configurations.

#### 4. Nginx Service (`nginx`):

- **image**: Uses the `nginx:stable` Docker image.
- **volumes**: 
  - Mounts configuration files, SSL certificates, and other necessary data for the Nginx service.
- **ports**: Maps ports 80 and 443 between the container and the host.
- **env_file**: Loads environment variables from the `nginx.env` file.
- **command**: Executes a command on startup to handle Nginx configurations and then runs Nginx.
- **depends_on**: Specifies dependencies on other services: `vscode`, `grafana`, and `questdb`.

#### 5. Certbot Service (`certbot`):

- **image**: Uses the `certbot/certbot` Docker image.
- **ports**: No ports are mapped.
- **volumes**: 
  - Mounts directories related to SSL certificates and letsencrypt configurations.

### Volumes:

- **grafana-data**: Named volume for persisting Grafana data.
- **questdb-data**: Named volume for persisting QuestDB data.



## `init.yaml`

The `init.yaml` file is designed to set up the initial SSL certificate generation using Certbot for your Docker stack. 

#### Services:

**Certbot Service (`certbot`):**

- **image**: Utilizes the `certbot/certbot` Docker image.

- **network_mode**: Operates in the host network mode. This means the Certbot service will share the network namespace with the host, making it equivalent to running the container's process directly on the host itself.

- **volumes**: 
  - Maps the host's letsencrypt directories to the container. These directories store generated SSL certificates and associated configurations.
  - Maps the `./nginx/.well-known/` directory from the host to the `/usr/share/nginx/html/.well-known/` directory inside the container. This directory is often used for domain validation during the SSL certificate generation process.

## `README.md`

The `README.md` provides an overview and access details of the Docker services set up in the repository.

## `questdb_configuration.png`

### Data Sources / PostgreSQL

**Type:** PostgreSQL

#### Settings
- **Alerting supported:** ✅

#### PostgreSQL Connection
- **Name:** QuestDB
- **Default:** On
- **Host:** questdb:8812
- **Database:** qdb
- **User:** admin
- **Password:** configured
- **TLS/SSL Mode:** disable

#### Connection limits
- **Max open:** unlimited
- **Max idle:** 2
- **Max lifetime:** 14400

#### PostgreSQL details
- **Version:** 9.4
- **TimescaleDB:** Enabled
- **Min time interval:** 1m

#### User Permission
The database user should only be granted `SELECT` permissions on the specified database & tables you want to query. Grafana does not validate that queries are safe so queries can contain any SQL statement. For example, statements like `DELETE FROM user;` and `DROP TABLE user;` would be executed. To protect against this we highly recommend you create a specific PostgreSQL user with restricted permissions. Check out the PostgreSQL Data Source Docs for more information.

#### Status
- **Database Connection:** OK



## `file.yaml`

### Grafana Dashboard Provisioning Configuration

This YAML file is a configuration for Grafana's provisioning system:

- `apiVersion`: Specifies the version of the provisioning API.
  
- `providers`: A list of ways to source the dashboard configurations.
  - `name`: A unique name for this provider.
  - `type`: The type of provider, in this case, it's a file-based provider.
  - `disableDeletion`: Controls if dashboards can be deleted from the UI. Here, it's set to false, allowing deletion.
  - `updateIntervalSeconds`: The frequency, in seconds, with which Grafana will scan for changed dashboards.
  - `allowUiUpdates`: Determines if changes made in the UI are saved. Here, it's set to true.
  - `options`: Specific options for the file provider:
    - `path`: The path in the filesystem where the dashboard JSON files are stored.
    - `foldersFromFilesStructure`: This option, when set to true, allows Grafana to use the filesystem's structure to determine the folder for the dashboard.



## `questdb.yml`

### Grafana Datasource Configuration for QuestDB

This YAML file details the configuration for integrating Grafana with QuestDB using the PostgreSQL datasource:

- `apiVersion`: Specifies the version of the provisioning API.

- `datasources`: A list of data sources Grafana should connect to.
  - `name`: Name of the data source, in this case, "QuestDB".
  - `type`: Specifies that QuestDB is being accessed as a PostgreSQL data source.
  - `access`: The mode for accessing the data source. "proxy" means requests are forwarded through the Grafana server.
  - `url`: The connection string to the QuestDB instance.
  - `database`: The database to connect to, here it is "qdb".
  - `user`: The user Grafana uses to connect to the database.
  - `uid`: A unique identifier for this data source, used in the dashboard JSON configurations.
  - `jsonData`: Additional JSON data for the PostgreSQL configuration:
    - `postgresVersion`: The version of PostgreSQL being emulated by QuestDB.
    - `sslmode`: Determines how SSL connections are handled; here, SSL is disabled.
    - `timescaledb`: Indicates if TimescaleDB extensions are used, set to false for QuestDB.
  - `secureJsonData`: Contains sensitive data:
    - `password`: The password for the database connection. Using an environment variable keeps the actual password out of the configuration file, enhancing security.




# A.3. Nginx Directory

- `.well-known`: Directory for well-known service information.
  - `.gitkeep`: Placeholder file to keep the directory in version control.

- `certs`: Contains certificate files.
  - `dhparam.pem`: Configuration file for Diffie-Hellman parameter.

- `conf.d`: Contains configuration files for individual Nginx sites.
  - `default.conf`: Default Nginx site configuration.
  - `default.conf.template`: Template for the default Nginx site configuration.

- `.htpasswd`: Password file for basic authentication in Nginx.
- `nginx.conf`: Main configuration file for Nginx.
- `nginx.env`: Environment variables for Nginx.



## `default.conf.template`

This configuration template is for an Nginx web server. Let me break it
down for you:

1.  ### WebSocket Configuration:

    -   The top-level **map** directive is used to set the appropriate
        headers for WebSocket connections. If the **Upgrade** HTTP
        header is set (indicating a WebSocket request), it sets the
        **Connection** header to **upgrade**. If not, it sets it to
        **close**.

2.  ### HTTP Server for Redirection:

    -   This server block listens on port 80 (the default HTTP port) and
        has a server name that matches requests for
        **vscode.\${DOMAIN}**, **questdb.\${DOMAIN}**, and
        **grafana.\${DOMAIN}**.

    -   Any request to this server block will be 302 redirected to the
        corresponding HTTPS (port 443) version of the URL.

    -   It also includes a location block to serve **.well-known** URLs
        directly, which are typically used for domain validation (e.g.,
        Let\'s Encrypt).

3.  ### HTTPS Servers:

    -   Three separate server blocks listen on port 443 (the default
        HTTPS port) and serve the VS Code, QuestDB, and Grafana
        applications, respectively.

    -   Each server block specifies SSL/TLS settings, including paths to
        certificate and key files, supported protocols, ciphers, etc.

    -   Strict Transport Security (HSTS) headers are set, which tells
        browsers to always use HTTPS when connecting to these domains in
        the future.

    -   Each server block includes a main **location** directive that
        proxies requests to the respective application\'s backend.
        Headers to support WebSocket connections are set here, if
        necessary.

    -   Another **location** block serves the **.well-known** URLs,
        which, as mentioned before, are used for domain validation.

Specifics to note:

-   #### VS Code:

    -   Requests are proxied to an internal service named **vscode** on
        port 8080.

-   #### QuestDB:

    -   Requests are proxied to an internal service named **questdb** on
        port 9000.

    -   Basic authentication is set up for QuestDB with a **.htpasswd**
        file, which contains user credentials.

-   #### Grafana:

    -   Requests are proxied to an internal service named **grafana** on
        port 3000.

The configuration uses template placeholders like **\${DOMAIN}**. Before
deploying this configuration, you would need to replace these
placeholders with actual values. This dynamic configuration allows for
easy customization and deployment across different environments or
domains.

Lastly, the repeated SSL settings across the three server blocks can be
consolidated into a shared configuration for maintainability. If you\'re
going to deploy this in production, make sure to review the SSL settings
for best practices and recent recommendations, as these can change over
time due to evolving security standards.


## `nginx.env`

- `DOMAIN=yourdomain`: This is an environment variable setting. 

  - **Key**: `DOMAIN`
  - **Value**: `yourdomain`
  
  This variable likely serves as a placeholder for the actual domain name that you'd use with your Nginx configurations. When deploying or starting up the Nginx server, the value for `DOMAIN` would replace any instances of `${DOMAIN}` in the configuration templates, such as in `default.conf.template`. By using environment variables, you can dynamically adjust the configurations without having to modify the configuration files directly.


## `default.conf`

The default.conf is generated from the default.conf.template by replacing the placeholder ${DOMAIN} with the desired domain value. This dynamic approach ensures flexibility in configuring different environments or domains using the same template.

## `nginx.conf`

This `nginx.conf` provides the foundational settings for the Nginx server. Any domain-specific configurations would typically be placed in separate files within the `/etc/nginx/conf.d/` directory, as indicated by the last include directive.


### General Settings:

- `user nginx;`: Specifies that Nginx should run as the `nginx` user. This is for security purposes to avoid running the server as root.
  
- `worker_processes auto;`: This directive specifies how many worker processes should be launched. The `auto` value allows Nginx to auto-detect and set the number of workers to the number of CPU cores available.

- `error_log` and `pid`: These directives define the location for the error log and the process ID file, respectively.

### Events Block:

- `worker_connections 1024;`: Defines the maximum number of simultaneous connections for each worker process. In this configuration, each worker can handle up to 1024 connections.

### HTTP Block:

- `include /etc/nginx/mime.types;`: Includes the MIME type definitions which determine how to respond depending on the file extension of the request.

- `default_type application/octet-stream;`: Sets the default MIME type for responses.

- `log_format main ...`: Specifies the format of the log entries for the access log.

- `access_log ...`: Specifies the location of the access log and uses the previously defined `main` log format.

- `sendfile on;`: Enables or disables the use of sendfile() for sending out file data.

- `keepalive_timeout 65;`: Determines the timeout of keep-alive connections. Here, it's set to 65 seconds.

- `include /etc/nginx/conf.d/*.conf;`: Includes all configuration files from the specified directory. This is where the `default.conf` would be read from if it exists in the `conf.d` directory.

##  `.htpasswd`


- `admin:$apr1$v0Pdxra0$CITSHJVwWQLSZqd5f4cMy0`: 

  - **Username**: `admin`
  - **Password Hash**: `$apr1$v0Pdxra0$CITSHJVwWQLSZqd5f4cMy0`

  This line represents a user's credentials for Basic Authentication. 

  - The **username** is `admin`.
  - The **password** is not shown in plain text. Instead, it's stored as an encrypted hash. The hash suggests that the password has been encrypted using the MD5 algorithm, indicated by the `$apr1$` prefix. This is a common practice in `.htpasswd` files to enhance security, so even if someone gains access to the file, they won't be able to decipher the actual password.

By adding entries like this to the `.htpasswd` file, you can secure parts of your QuestDB service with Basic Authentication, requiring a username and password for access.

## `dhparam.pem`

In the context of an Nginx setup, you would often see a directive like `ssl_dhparam /path/to/dhparam.pem`; in the server block to utilize the Diffie-Hellman parameters specified in the `dhparam.pem` file.

The `dhparam.pem` file contains Diffie-Hellman parameters. Here's a breakdown:

- **-----BEGIN DH PARAMETERS-----** and **-----END DH PARAMETERS-----**:
  These delimiters mark the beginning and end of the DH parameters. Anything between these delimiters is the encoded representation of the DH parameters.

- The long encoded string in between is the actual Diffie-Hellman parameter value, which is base64 encoded.

### What are Diffie-Hellman parameters?

Diffie-Hellman (DH) is a method used to securely exchange cryptographic keys over a public network. The `dhparam.pem` file contains the parameters used in this exchange, specifically for the DH key exchange in TLS/SSL communications.

The parameter itself represents a prime number and its length, often 2048, 3072, or 4096 bits, determines the strength of the encryption. The longer the prime, the more secure the key exchange, but it also requires more computational power.

### Why is it important?

When setting up an HTTPS server, it's recommended to generate strong DH parameters to ensure the security of the key exchange process. This avoids certain types of attacks, such as the "Logjam" attack, which targets servers using weak DH parameters.

In practice, once the `dhparam.pem` file is generated, it's typically referenced in the web server's configuration (e.g., Nginx or Apache) to instruct the server to use these parameters during the DH key exchange with clients.

### Note:
Always keep this file secure, as it's a crucial part of your server's cryptographic setup. While having it exposed doesn't directly compromise your server's private keys, using weak or default parameters can compromise the security of your connections.


## `.gitkeep`


### `.well-known` Directory

- **Purpose**: The `.well-known` directory is a standard used by internet protocols and services to discover policy and other information about the host (web server). It's typically found in the root directory of a domain.

  For example, it's commonly used for domain validation during the SSL certificate issuance process by services like Let's Encrypt. By placing specific files inside the `.well-known` directory, the domain owner can prove control over the domain to the certificate issuer.

- **Location**: Within the `nginx` directory structure, indicating that this directory will be served by the Nginx web server.

### `.gitkeep` File

- **Purpose**: By design, Git doesn't track empty directories. The `.gitkeep` file is a convention, not a Git feature, used to ensure that an otherwise empty directory is committed to a Git repository.

- **Naming**: There's nothing special about the `.gitkeep` name. The name was chosen for clarity, but any file can be used to make Git track an empty directory. Some projects may also use an empty `.gitignore` file for this purpose.

### How they work together

Placing a `.gitkeep` file inside the `.well-known` directory ensures that the directory structure is maintained in the Git repository even if no other files are present. This is particularly useful in initial project setups or templates where you want to preserve the directory structure but might not yet have the specific files that will reside there in the future.

In the context of the `nginx` setup, having a `.well-known` directory ensures that Nginx can serve any files placed there in the future, especially when setting up or renewing SSL certificates using challenges that require placing specific files in the `.well-known` directory.
